## Udacity Udagram - Refactor Monolith to Microservices: Image Filtering Application

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into two parts:
1. Frontend - Angular web application built with Ionic Framework : folder udagram-frontend and udagram-reverseproxy folder for reverse proxy application.
2. Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application divided in two microservices: folders udagram-api-feed and udagram-api-user. 


## Key Achievements: 
1. Docker images in your repository in DockerHub
2. TravisCI build pipeline showing successful build jobs
3. Kubernetes kubectl get pods output
4. Kubernetes kubectl describe services output
5. Kubernetes kubectl describe hpa output
6. Kubernetes kubectl logs <your pod name> output

All the images are in screenshoot folded in the project directory
