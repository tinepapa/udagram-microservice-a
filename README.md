## Udacity Udagram - Refactor Monolith to Microservices: Image Filtering Application

The project application, Udagram - an Image Filtering application, allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice. It has two components :

2.	Backend RESTful API - Node-Express application
In this project you will:
•	Refactor the monolith application to microservices
•	Set up each microservice to be run in its own Docker container
•	Set up a Travis CI pipeline to push images to Dockerhub
•	Deploy the Dockerhub images to the Kubernetes cluster
